‚úçÔ∏è About
This code snippet defines a Solidity smart contract called WavePortal, facilitating a wave-like interaction between users. It keeps track of the total number of waves sent and stores wave details such as sender address, message, and timestamp in a struct called Wave. Users can send waves by calling the wave function, which increments the total wave count, logs the wave, and potentially rewards the sender with ether based on a random condition. The contract also provides functions to retrieve all waves and the total wave count. Additionally, it includes event logging for new waves, enhancing transparency and traceability.
